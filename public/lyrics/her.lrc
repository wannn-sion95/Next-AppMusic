[00:00.00] ....
[00:06.58] (Hold me close) look me dead in my eyes
[00:10.04] (Dead in my) 'til the day that I die
[00:13.39] (Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
[00:16.33] (With you, I'm alive) with you, I'm alive
[00:19.78] Fell in love, but it left me lonely
[00:23.31] Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
[00:27.26] I didn't know what I was looking for
[00:30.55] 'Til I found her
[00:38.27] (I found her)
[00:44.72] Without her
[00:47.25] I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
[00:47.93] There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
[00:51.42] 'Til I found her (oh, oh)
[00:59.94] Found me lonely
[01:01.40] Lost and only one step away from just giving up slowly
[01:06.51] I was a mess, I was afraid
[01:08.42] I'd be the girl who just put up a wall, no one could break
[01:11.72] 'Til I found him
[01:13.43] Running through the wild with half of a heart
[01:16.19] Made me a whole one out of the parts
[01:19.18] Suddenly it's like I'm healed
[01:21.57] Didn't know that love was real
[01:22.95] Until I found
[01:25.60] (Baby, hold me close) look me dead in my eyes
[01:29.73] (Dead in my) 'til the day that I die
[01:33.24] (Dead inside) I just wanna feel alive
[01:35.96] (With you, I'm alive) with you, I'm, uh
[01:39.99] Fell in love, but it left me lonely
[01:43.18] Tried to trust, but it burned me slowly
[01:47.30] I didn't know what I was looking for
[01:50.29] 'Til I found her
[01:57.56] (I found her, oh, oh)
[02:05.14] Without her
[02:06.99] I'm a mess (I'm a mess)
[02:07.79] There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
[02:11.13] 'Til I found her (oh, oh)
[02:18.10] Without her
[02:20.36] I'm a mess
[02:21.00] There was nothing 'bout that love that made sense, I was stressed
[02:23.87] 'Til I found her (oh, oh)
[02:30.69] 'Til I found her
[02:38.14] Ooh-ooh-ooh
